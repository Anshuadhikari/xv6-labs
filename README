You are working on the util Xv6 lab for UMW CPSC 405.

util is our first Xv6 lab.

We are learning how to use the Unix API to create utility applications.

Several standard Linux utility programs are provided with Xv6.

You are to augment the provided utility programs with the following:

1. kitty
2. sleep
3. pingpong
4. primes
5. find
6. xargs

You can see all of the utility programs using the ls command.

The programs that you are implementing do not work. The print, for example,

sleep does not work
